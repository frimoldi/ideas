# Ideas :bulb:
This is where I dump every single thing that I think of building. </br>

I'll try to formulate all of them with a problem statement and a proposed solution. </br>

Feel free to steal one if you think it's good.

And if you do, reach out to me! maybe we can build it together ;)

_disclaimer: most will probably be absolute garbage._

## 1) NFT smart contract factory for artists
__Problem__:</br>
NFT artists/creators need a developer to write & deploy a smart contract so that they can be able to sell their work.
Most of these contracts are pretty similar. At least at the very begining, where all they need is to start minting.</br>
__Solution__:</br>
Web app where a non-dev user can visually configure a set of parameters, such as the amount of tokens, royalty %, etc.</br>
This will result in an actual smart contract that the user would be able to deploy and use to start minting their work. No coding required.
